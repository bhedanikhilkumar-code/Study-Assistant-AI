# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately and responsibly.

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security concerns.
- Share details via email with the maintainers, including:
  - A clear description of the issue
  - Reproduction steps or proof of concept
  - Potential impact and affected components
  - Suggested mitigation (if available)

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Report the issue privately to maintainers.
2. Allow a reasonable remediation window before public disclosure.
3. Coordinate on a disclosure timeline when a fix is available.

We will make a best effort to:

- Acknowledge receipt promptly
- Investigate and validate reports
- Provide status updates during remediation
- Credit reporters when appropriate (with permission)

## Contact Instructions

Please contact maintainers through one of the following channels:

- Security email: `security@studyassistantai.dev`
- Backup contact: open a **private** security advisory in the repository's Security tab

If the primary email is unavailable, use the private security advisory flow on GitHub.
